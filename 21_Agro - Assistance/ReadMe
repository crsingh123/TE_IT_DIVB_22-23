Project Description:
In the agriculture sector, the farmers and -businesses make many decisions which include factors influencing them.
The main intention for agricultural planning is the accurate yield estimation for various crops. Environmental conditions like temperature, humidity 
and soil moisture have made it all more relevant for farmers to use the data and acquire help to create critical farming decisions. Proposed project focuses
on the analysis of the agriculture data and finding optimal parameters to maximize crop production using Machine Learning. Also focus is on 
getting the correct information regarding the factors affecting plant growth. The main motive of the project is to assist the farmer in maximizing 
yield of their crops. and supporting quality production.In the agriculture sector, the farmers and -businesses make many decisions which include factors
