Human Activity recognition

Project Discription:

Human activity recognition (HAR) is the process of automatically identifying human activities based on sensor data, typically from wearable devices such as smartwatches
or smartphones. Machine learning is commonly used to develop HAR systems.


The general approach to developing a HAR system involves the following steps:


Data collection: Collecting labeled data of various activities such as walking, running, sitting, standing, etc., using sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and 
magnetometers.


Feature extraction: Extracting relevant features from the collected sensor data. These features can be time-domain features, frequency-domain features, or statistical 
features, among others.


Model selection: Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm, such as decision trees, support vector machines, or deep neural networks, based on the type and
amount of data available and the accuracy requirements.


Training: Using the labeled data to train the chosen model to accurately classify the different human activities.


Testing: Evaluating the performance of the trained model on new, unseen data to determine its accuracy and effectiveness.

Overall, the goal of HAR is to develop a robust and accurate system that can automatically recognize a wide range of human activities based on sensor data.
